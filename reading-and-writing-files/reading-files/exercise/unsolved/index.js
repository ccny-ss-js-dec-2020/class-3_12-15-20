/*

1. Create a .txt file in this directory. Use the terminal to create the text file please.
2. Using process.argv, check to see if the 3rd argument (process.arg[2]) you're using is in the text file
3. If there are any arguments after the 3rd argument (process.arg[2]), dont run the logic
4. when checking if the text is in the data file, you can set the text to lowercase for the logic
   i.e. if the file reads 'bad', and you input 'Bad', the logic should state that the text is in the file
